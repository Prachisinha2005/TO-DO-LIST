"In this project, I have created a To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks dynamically. The interface is styled using CSS for a clean and responsive look, while JavaScript handles the task management functions. This project demonstrates basic web development skills and DOM manipulation with JavaScript."
